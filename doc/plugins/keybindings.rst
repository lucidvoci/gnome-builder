Keyboard Shortcuts
##################

Builder's powerful shortcut engine provides the ability for simple shortcuts, complex chords, shortcut themes, and user overrides.
To support this, it is important to understand where to register the necessary information for your shortcuts to give users maximum flexibility.

Accelerators
============

Accelerator is the term we use for defining which keys need to be pressed for a shortcut.
Shortcuts in Builder are defined similar to Gtk with the exception that you may define multiple keys separted by the | (pipe) character.

To define a keyboard shortcut for the combination of ``Control`` and ``C`` use ``<Control>c``.
Modifiers such as ``Control``, ``Super``, ``Hyper``, ``Alt``, ``Primary``, and ``Shift`` are placed within XML-style element tags.

.. code-block:: xml
   :caption: A list of properly formatted shortcut accelerators

   <Primary>c
   <Control><Shift>p
   <Control><Alt>n
   <Super>k
   <Shift>Page_Up
   <Alt>1
   <Shift>comma
   <Shift>plus
   <Control>x|<Control>c

.. tip:: Use ``Primary`` instead of ``Control`` if you'd like ``Command`` to be used on macOSâ„¢.

Some key names are not obvious.
Refer to ``gdk/gdkkeysyms.h`` for their name.
For example, ``grave`` is the name for ``GDK_KEY_grave``.

.. tip:: You may find the ``xev`` program useful to locate the name of a key.

Registering a Shortcut
----------------------

Shortcuts should be registered with the ``IdeShortcutManager`` in your ``GObjectClass.class_init`` function.
This allows both the user and shortcut themes to override the accelerator.

.. code-block:: c

   static void
   my_widget_class_init (MyWidget *widget)
   {
      /* ... */

      ide_shortcut_manager_add_command (NULL,
                                        "org.gnome.builder.commands.my-command",
                                        "<Primary><Shift>z",
                                        _("Shorctuts Window Page"),
                                        _("Shortcuts Window Group"),
                                        _("Shortcut Title"),
                                        _("Shortcut Description if necessary"));
   }

Now we need to enable our shortcut controller to handle our registered command ``org.gnome.builder.commands.my-command``.
We just want to focus our widget when this command occurs, so we will dispatch the ``grab-focus`` signal.
You may want to connect other signals, actions, or callbacks in your code.

.. code-block:: c

   static void
   my_widget_init (MyWidget *widget)
   {
     /* ... */

     IdeShortcutController *controller = ide_shortcut_controller_find (GTK_WIDGET (self));

     /* If you want to activate a signal */
     ide_shortcut_controller_add_command_signal (controller,
                                                 "org.gnome.builder.commands.my-command",
                                                 "grab-focus", 0);

     /* If instead you want to activate a GAction */
     ide_shortcut_controller_add_command_action (controller,
                                                 "org.gnome.builder.commands.my-command",
                                                 "build-manager.build");

     /* Or just a callback instead */
     ide_shortcut_controller_add_command_callback (controller,
                                                   "org.gnome.builder.commands.my-command",
                                                   (GtkCallback) my_callback_func,
                                                   user_data,
                                                   destroy_notify);
   }


Extending a Shortcut Theme
==========================

All Builder users are using a shortcut theme to some degree.
The default shortcuts are also mapped via the ``default`` shortcut theme.
Therefore, your plugin may want to support different key themes slightly differently.

For example, you might want a different shortcut for the ``emacs`` theme than the ``default`` or ``vim`` shortcut theme.

To do this, add a new ``themename.keytheme`` file to your plugins ``GResources`` in the ``keybindings`` direction.
This should be something similar to ``/opt/gnome/builder/plugins/my-plugin/keybindings/default.keytheme``.
Builder will automatically load and merge these keytheme extensions into the matching keytheme.

.. code-block:: xml
   :caption: Extending the ``default.keytheme``

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <theme name="default">
     <shortcut accelerator="<Control><Shift>r"
                   command="org.gnome.builder.commands.my-command"/>
   </theme>

If you want to extend shortcuts only when focused within a certain widget type, use a ``<context>`` to define the widget focus.
Note that some key themes have more complex "modal" contexts (such as Vim).

.. code-block:: xml
   :caption: Extending the ``default.keytheme`` for a given widget type

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <theme name="default">

     <!-- Only map command when focused in an GtkEntry -->
     <context name="GtkEntry">
       <shortcut accelerator="<Control><Shift>r"
                     command="org.gnome.builder.commands.my-command"/>
     </context>

   </theme>


Creating a Shortcut Theme
=========================

Builder has support for "shortcut themes" which are a collection of keyboard shortcuts that tend to emulate an existing editor.
Users can select a shortcut theme to make Builder feel more familiar.

In some cases, you may just want to map a series of keybindings to actions in Builder.
In other cases, you may want to emulate complex "modes" similar to editors like Vim.
Builder also support multi-press "chords" familiar to Emacs users.


.. code-block:: xml
   :caption: Save this to ``gedit.keytheme``

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <theme name="gedit">
     <property name="title">Gedit</property>
     <property name="subtitle">Emulates the Gedit text editor</property>

     <!-- Keythemes support both &lt; &gt; < and > -->
     <shortcut accelerator="<control>q" action="app.quit"/>

     <!-- Only actions and commands can be activated outside of a context.
          Signals require a context as they must be attached to a widget. -->
     <shortcut accelerator="<Primary>c" command="org.gnome.builder.commands.my-command"/>

     <!-- You can set accelerators for widgets by using their name for the context -->
     <context name="GtkEntry">
       <!-- signal="select-all" activates the GtkEntry::select-all signal -->
       <shortcut accelerator="<Control>a" signal="select-all"/>

       <!-- If you need to pass a parameter, use param elements -->
       <shortcut accelerator="Delete">
         <signal name="delete-from-cursor">
           <param>chars</param>
           <param>1</param>
         </signal>

       </shortcut>
     </context>

   </theme>
