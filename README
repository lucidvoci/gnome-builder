----

Builder attempts to be an IDE for writing software for GNOME. It does not try
to be a generic IDE, but one specialized for writing GNOME software. We believe
that this focus will help us to build something great.

If you would like to help in this effort, join our IRC channel and we will help
you find something to work on.

Builder is written in C, but some aspects of Builder may be written in another
language if it makes sense.

----

Builder is developed in conjunction with GNOME releases. This means that we
often contribute to, and depend on, features being developed in other GNOME
modules.

----

Builder is built using meson:

  meson _build --prefix=/usr
  ninja -C _build
  sudo ninja -C _build install

----

Alternatively, you can build Builder from git using jhbuild. If you are
unfamiliar with jhbuild, the following will help you get started.

  git clone git://git.gnome.org/jhbuild.git
  cd jhbuild
  ./autogen.sh --simple-install
  make
  make install
  jhbuild build gnome-builder
  jhbuild run gnome-builder

If you have problems building or running Builder, please contact us on IRC
(link is at the top of this file) and we will help you out.
